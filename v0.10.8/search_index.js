To increase this limit, set CLKP_TRACE_MAX_SIZE to a larger value, e.g. ENV[\"CLKP_TRACE_MAX_SIZE\"] = \"100 * 1024\" for 100 MB.\n\nAfter the Julia session exits, traces will be written to opencl-kernel-profiler.trace in the current directory, which can be changed using the CLKP_TRACE_DEST environment variable. These traces can then be visualized by going to https://ui.perfetto.dev/ and opening the trace file.\n\nopencl-kernel-profiler works by intercepting calls to the OpenCL API and recording the execution time of kernels as well as events on the host side. It will also log the OpenCL/SPIR-V source code of the kernels alongside the traced calls to clEnqueueNDRangekernel, which can be useful for debugging.","category":"section"},{"location":"#OpenCL","page":"OpenCL","title":"OpenCL","text":"Julia interface for the OpenCL parallel computation API\n\nThis package aims to be a complete solution for OpenCL programming in Julia, similar in scope to [PyOpenCL] for Python.
